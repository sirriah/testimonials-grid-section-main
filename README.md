## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I made this solution because I wanted to practise working with CSS grid. This is nice little testimonial section.
For this grid, I used 'grid-template-areas'.

### Continued development

I take this as preparation for bigger challenge from FM with asymetric design - [Creative angency single-page site](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/creative-agency-singlepage-site-Pq6V3I2RM/)
